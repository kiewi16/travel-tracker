# TravelTracker
Travel Tracker is an application designed to create an easy travel planning experience for users and travel agents.

# Overview
- A user-friendly dashboard that displays upcoming, pending, and past trips for a user as well as the total a user has spent year-to-date on travel.
- An interactive trip booking form that allows users to select a destination and provide the desired number of travelers, trip duration, and departure date.
- Users can calculate their esitmated trip cost prior to submitting the trip for travel agent approval. 
- After submitting a trip, the user will see the trip with relevant details in the pending trips section. 

## Goals and Objectives
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
- Create a clear and accessible user interface
- Make network requests to retrieve and post data
- Implement a robust testing suite using test-driven development (TDD)
- Write DRY, resuable code that follows Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

# Challenges
- DOM manipulation of pending trips section
- Creating an aesthetically pleasing design. My energies were spent on the application functionality. 

# Wins
- Allocated time at project kickoff to develop a solid understanding of the available data and create a plan to manipulate that data to extra the data points needed for project completion. 
- Increased confindence that I have the ability to navigate through challenges that arise during a project
- `GET` and `POST` requests to a back-end API
- Thoughtful error handling that guides a user to complete all input fields needed to calculate trip cost and book a trip 

# Future Features
- Add additional trip details to the upcoming trips section. 
- Add a countdown until the user's next trip 
- Add a logout button that takes the user back to the log in page
- Make make responsive to different screen sizes 

# Final Reflections 
During the development of my Travel Tracker application, I experienced significant personal growth. I have increased confidence in my ability to problem solve. I will continue to hone my CSS skills to craft more aesthetically pleasing and visually exciting applications.
